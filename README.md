# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. start the program
2. Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
3. Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
4. End the program

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
